# HOC - Higher Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a component.
- It's Enhancing the existing component, I mean it will add more data on top up existing component.
- It's a pure function, Means it will not changed the existing data.

# 1.React Redux
- When you press the Add button, It dispatch the action, Which calls the reducer function, And   Modifies the slice of a redux store(store).
- Add Button ->  Dispatch the Action  -> Calls the Reducer -> Update the slice(Have some data).
- How to read data from cart(slice) -> we have to use the Selector for reading the data from store.
- 1. Send data to store -> Once clike on the Add button, It's dispacth the action then call's the reducer function, which updates the slice of a redux store.
- 2. Receive data from store -> Our component(ex: Header comp) is subscribed to store, then using the selector as inbuilt func, we can recived the data in our component(ex: Header comp).

# 2. Redux Toolkit
- Install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
- Build our store
- Connect our stor to our app
- create slice (cartSlice)
- dispacth(action)
